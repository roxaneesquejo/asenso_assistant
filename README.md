ASENSO (AI-Powered Solution Empowering Nascent Small-scale Opportunities) is an agentic AI-powered microfinance lending website which aims to reduce the logistical burden on financial institutions through efficient, automated processes, reducing the time taken to provide micro-loans to eligible borrowers.

ASENSO aids with the encoding, verification, processing, and approval of loan applications. This is done through the use of Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR) and extensive use of AI to smoothly handle the loan applications processes traditionally done manually with minimal human intervention. 

Demo accounts:

The Officerâ€™s role is to upload the borrower's documents for ASENSO to verify them and assess his/her credit.

The Client can review their loan application status by entering their application number, whereupon a summary of their loan application assessment is shown. 
    Username: client
    Password: password123

The Admin will have access to the Administrator Dashboard
    Username: admin
    Password: password123
